# trail-quest
Combines mapping, route optimization, real-time data integration, and user-friendly itinerary planning.
Development Steps

1* Planning (1-2 weeks): Define user flows (e.g., map interface for region selection, drag-and-drop POIs). Sketch wireframes using tools like Figma. Research legal aspects (e.g., API terms, data privacy via GDPR).

2* Setup and Prototyping (2-4 weeks): Build a minimum viable product (MVP). Integrate a mapping library (e.g., Flutter's google_maps_flutter) and test basic route generation.

3* API Integration (4-6 weeks): Fetch POIs, calculate routes/times, and add weather polling. For times: Use routing APIs to get walking/driving durations; add user-defined observation time.

4* Itinerary Logic and UI (4 weeks): Implement optimization (e.g., sort POIs by proximity). Display as a timeline: "Start at 9 AM → Drive 20 min → Hike 1 hour → Observe 30 min." Use sliders for custom times.

5* Alerts and Extras (2-3 weeks): Set up push notifications for weather. Add offline caching for maps/trails.

6* Testing and Launch (2-4 weeks): Test on real devices in outdoor scenarios. Deploy to app stores; start with beta users.
